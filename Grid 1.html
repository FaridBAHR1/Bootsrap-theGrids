                        <h1>Algorithm</h1>
                        <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                        <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for building intelligent agents that can learn to make decisions by interacting with their environment.
                            RL algorithms use trial-and-error learning to discover optimal policies that maximize a reward signal.
                            These algorithms work well in many domains, including robotics, games, and control systems.</p>
                        <h3>Sequential data</h3>
                        <p>However, when it comes to learning from sequential data, such as text or speech, traditional RL algorithms face challenges due to the high-dimensional and sparse nature of the data.
                            This is where Transformers can be useful.
                            Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has shown significant improvements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation, language modeling, and text classification.
                            They are particularly useful for processing sequential data because they can learn long-term dependencies and capture complex patterns in the data.</p> 
                        <h3>Transformers & Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                        <p>One way to combine Transformers and RL is to use the former to preprocess the sequential data and extract useful features that can be used as input to the latter.
                            This approach is called RL with input embeddings, where the embeddings are learned by a Transformer model.
                            Another approach is to use a Transformer model as a critic in an RL framework.
                            The critic is a function that estimates the value of a state or action, and it is used to guide the learning process by providing feedback on the quality of the decisions made by the agent.
                            In this approach, the Transformer model learns to estimate the value of the state or action based on the input sequence, and this value is used as the feedback signal in the RL algorithm.</p>

                        <h3>Uses of Transformers & Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                        <p>Here are specific uses of Transformers & Reinforcement Learning:</p>
                        <ul class="list-group list-group-numbered"></ul>
                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Chatbots: Transformers can be used to preprocess the input text and extract useful features such as word embeddings or contextual representations.
                                These features can then be used as input to an RL agent, which can learn to generate appropriate responses to user queries based on the reward signal received from the environment.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Game playing: RL agents can be trained to play complex games such as Go, chess, or video games.
                                In this case, a Transformer model can be used to preprocess the input data, such as the game board or video frames, and extract useful features that can be used as input to the RL agent.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Robotics: Reinforcement Learning has been used to train robots to perform complex tasks such as grasping objects or walking.
                                A Transformer model can be used to preprocess sensory data such as camera images or lidar scans and extract useful features that can be used as input to the RL agent.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Natural Language Generation: RL can be used to train natural language generation models that can generate coherent and fluent sentences.
                                In this case, a Transformer model can be used to preprocess the input text and extract useful features that can be used as input to the RL agent.
                                It can learn to generate appropriate responses based on the reward signal received from the environment.</li>
